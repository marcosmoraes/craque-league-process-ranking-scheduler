## Technical Decision History
1. **Serverless Architecture**
   - Decision: Use AWS Lambda with Serverless Framework
   - Reason: Automatic scalability and cost-effectiveness
   - Date: [Decision date]

2. **Message Queue**
   - Decision: Use AWS SQS for processing
   - Reason: Reliable message delivery and scalability
   - Date: [Decision date]

3. **Database Connection**
   - Decision: Use MongoDB with connection pooling
   - Reason: Efficient resource usage and performance
   - Date: [Decision date]
